"""
AI Agents Skills Assessment - build Zippy for production.

Everything below is scaffolding. The three TODO blocks are yours to complete.

  TASK 1  Tool definition + the bounded agent loop
  TASK 2  Harden it - security boundaries + a tool that will not crash the loop
  TASK 3  Persistent memory + a run summary

Run it with the prompt as the first argument:

    python3 /root/code/assessment_agent.py "Book a meeting called Standup on Monday"

Do not rename this file, and do not rename any function or constant already
defined in it - the grader looks for them by name.
