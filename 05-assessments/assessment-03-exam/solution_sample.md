# Reference solution - AI Agents Skills Assessment

One lab, merged: three build tasks plus five quick checks, scored together out
of 100 with a 75% pass mark.

Everything the learner writes is in `/root/code/assessment_agent.py`. Only the
`TODO TASK` blocks change; the rest of the file is as shipped.

**This file is the only place the answers live.** `questions.json` carries no
`solution` fields, so nothing is revealed in the lab after scoring - the same
pattern the `cncf`, `iac` and `postgres` assessments already use.

| Item | Weight | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Task 1 - Make it work | 25 | `TOOL_DEFINED` `TOOL_TRIGGER_DESC` `TOOL_ENUM` `LOOP_BOUNDED` `LOOP_FINISH_REASON` `LOOP_TOOL_RESULTS` `LOOP_TRACKS_USAGE` `RUN_BOOKED` |
| Quick check - the iteration guard | 5 | MCQ |
| Quick check - who is in control | 5 | MCQ |
| Task 2 - Make it safe | 25 | `INJECTION_BLOCKED` `INJECTION_CASE_INSENSITIVE` `OUTPUT_REDACTED` `KEY_ABSENT` `TRY_EXCEPT` `RETURNS_ERROR_STRING` `TOOL_UNKNOWN_SAFE` |
| Quick check - defence in depth | 5 | MCQ |
| Task 3 - Make it remember and report | 25 | `MEMORY_INJECTED` `MEMORY_GUARD_OK` `SUMMARY_PRINTED` `TOKENS_COUNTED` |
| Quick check - why conversations get expensive | 5 | MCQ |
| Quick check - workflow or agent | 5 | MCQ |

75 points of build, 25 points of reasoning, 19 automated checks.

**The three tasks are independent.** Every Task 2 and Task 3 check calls the
learner's functions directly, with the memory store and run log seeded by the
grader, so each task scores its full weight whether or not the others are done.

## Task 1a - the tool definition

### Add this to the `tools` list, replacing the `TODO TASK 1a` comment

```python
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "book_meeting",
            "description": (
                "Book a meeting on the user's calendar. Returns a confirmation "
                "string with the booked time. Use this when the user asks to "
                "schedule, book, or set up a meeting."
            ),
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "title": {"type": "string", "description": "Short meeting title."},
                    "day": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Day of the week for the meeting.",
                        "enum": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
                    },
                },
                "required": ["title", "day"],
            },
        },
    },
```

## Task 1b - the bounded loop

### Add this inside `run_agent`, replacing the `TODO TASK 1b` comment

The `response.usage` lines belong to task 3, shown here in their final position:

```python
    for i in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        run_log["iterations"] += 1

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=MODEL, messages=messages, tools=tools
        )
        if response.usage:
            run_log["prompt_tokens"] += response.usage.prompt_tokens
            run_log["completion_tokens"] += response.usage.completion_tokens

        choice = response.choices[0]

        if choice.finish_reason == "tool_calls":
            messages.append(choice.message)
            for call in choice.message.tool_calls:
                args = json.loads(call.function.arguments)
                result = execute_tool(call.function.name, args)
                messages.append({
                    "role": "tool",
                    "tool_call_id": call.id,
                    "content": str(result),
                })
            continue

        return choice.message.content

    return "Stopped: reached the iteration limit before finishing."
```

## Task 2 - the three stubs

`re` is already imported in the starter. Each snippet replaces that
function's `TODO TASK 2x` comment - the surrounding `def` line and docstring stay:

```python
def detect_injection(text):
    lowered = text.lower()
    return any(pattern in lowered for pattern in INJECTION_PATTERNS)


def filter_output(text):
    text = re.sub(r"sk-[A-Za-z0-9\-]+", "REDACTED", text)
    text = re.sub(r"api_key=\S+", "api_key=REDACTED", text)
    return text


def execute_tool(name, arguments):
    run_log["tool_calls"] += 1
    try:
        handler = HANDLERS[name]
        return handler(**arguments)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
```

Two checks in this task are stricter than they look:

- `INJECTION_CASE_INSENSITIVE` tests both directions - an uppercase injection
  must be caught **and** a legitimate prompt must not be, so `return True`
  scores nothing.
- `RETURNS_ERROR_STRING` calls `execute_tool("flaky_lookup", ...)` directly and
  requires the returned string to carry the original exception text, so
  `return "Error"` alone does not pass - the `{e}` interpolation is required.
- `TOOL_UNKNOWN_SAFE` calls `execute_tool("no_such_tool", {})`. That is a
  `KeyError` on the `HANDLERS` lookup, which is why the lookup belongs inside
  the `try` rather than above it.

## Task 3 - memory and monitoring

### Add this inside `build_system_prompt` / `print_summary`, replacing their `TODO TASK 3a` and `3b` comments

```python
def build_system_prompt():
    prompt = (
        "You are Zippy, a fast and concise personal assistant. "
        "Use the tools available to you rather than guessing. "
        "Keep every answer to two sentences or fewer."
    )
    memory = load_memory()
    if memory:
        prompt += "\n\nKnown user preferences:\n"
        for k, v in memory.items():
            prompt += f"- {k}: {v}\n"
    return prompt


def print_summary():
    total = run_log["prompt_tokens"] + run_log["completion_tokens"]
    print("\n--- Execution Summary ---")
    print(f"Iterations: {run_log['iterations']}")
    print(f"Tool calls: {run_log['tool_calls']}")
    print(f"Total tokens: {total}")
```

The usage accumulation that feeds this total is part of Task 1's loop above and
is graded there, by `LOOP_TRACKS_USAGE`. Task 3's own checks seed `run_log`
directly, so `print_summary` is graded on whether it sums and prints what it is
given - `TOKENS_COUNTED` seeds 120 + 30 and looks for 150.

`MEMORY_GUARD_OK` is the other half of task 3a: with an empty store the
`Known user preferences:` heading must not appear at all, which is what the
`if memory:` guard is for.

## Quick check answers

These explanations used to render in the lab's Solution tab. They now live here only - the exam ships no solutions.

### Quick check 1

Your loop is bounded by `MAX_ITERATIONS` rather than running on `while True`.

What failure does that bound actually prevent?

- A malformed tool call the dispatcher cannot parse, raised part-way through a run
- A tool exception that tears the process down before any answer is returned
- **An agent that never stops asking for tools, spending tokens until someone notices**  ← correct
- Tool results filling the context window until the provider rejects the request

The loop exits when `finish_reason` says stop - which relies entirely on the model deciding it is finished. A confused model, a tool that keeps returning errors, or a task it cannot complete will happily keep asking for tool calls forever, and every pass is a paid API call. `MAX_ITERATIONS` turns an unbounded cost into a bounded one.

Malformed calls and crashing tools are real problems too - but those are what Task 2's `try/except` is for. Different failure, different guard.

### Quick check 2

You defined the tools. Your code executes them. Your code owns the loop.

So what does the LLM actually decide?

- Nothing - your orchestration code picks the tool by matching keywords in the request
- Both the choice and the execution - the API runs your tool functions on its servers
- Only whether to continue; the SDK resolves which tool to call from the schema
- **Which tools to call, with what arguments and in what order - your code executes them**  ← correct

This is the split that makes something an agent. The model is the decision-maker: it reads the request and your tool *descriptions* and responds with `tool_calls`. Your code is the hands: it dispatches to the real function, appends the result as a `tool` message, and calls the model again.

The API never runs your functions - it only asks you to. That is also why the description you wrote in Task 1a matters so much: it is the entire basis on which the model chooses.

### Quick check 3

In the OpenClaw codebase, `detect_injection()` lives in `orchestrator.py`, which runs *before* the agent loop is ever entered, while `filter_output()` lives in `agent.py` on the way out, and per-tool rate limits sit around the tool dispatcher.

What design principle is that layout expressing?

- Least privilege - each component is granted only the access its own job requires
- **Defence in depth - each layer guards a different boundary, and none covers them all**  ← correct
- Fail-safe defaults - when a check cannot complete the request is denied, not allowed
- Zero trust - every call is authenticated regardless of where in the system it came from

Each layer sits at a different boundary and stops a different thing. Injection detection at the input boundary stops hostile instructions before a single token reaches the model - the only place that is reliable, because a strong enough injection can override a system prompt. Rate limits sit at the tool boundary and cap the damage a runaway or manipulated agent can do. Output filtering sits at the exit and catches secrets leaking outward.

You just built two of those three. A system prompt asking nicely for good behaviour is not a security control; these are, and they are placed where the traffic actually crosses.

### Quick check 4

Your agent has been in conversation for 20 turns. Each new API call is slower and costs more than the last, even though your latest question is short.

Why?

- The model keeps session state server-side, and longer sessions bill at a higher rate
- Each turn prepends a fresh system prompt, so the instructions are re-read every call
- **Every call re-sends the entire messages list, so the prompt grows with every turn**  ← correct
- Replies lengthen as context accumulates, and output tokens dominate what you are billed

LLMs are stateless. The model remembers nothing between calls - the only reason it appears to remember within a conversation is that you resend the whole thing every time.

That growing `messages` list is billed as prompt tokens on every single call, and it eats into the context window. It is also exactly why Task 3 stored preferences in a *file* rather than just letting the conversation grow: a fact you need next week should not cost you tokens on every call between now and then.

### Quick check 5

Two requirements land on your desk:

**A.** Every incoming support email must be classified, translated to English, and written to a ticket - the same three steps, in the same order, every time.

**B.** *"Find out why my last invoice was higher than usual"* - which may need the billing tool, the usage tool, both, or neither, depending on what it finds.

Which is which?

- **A is a workflow and B is an agent - fixed steps need no model deciding control flow**  ← correct
- Both are agents, since each one calls a model and that is what makes a system agentic
- A is an agent and B is a workflow, because B states a clear goal at the outset
- Both are workflows, since each can be written as a fixed sequence of API calls

A workflow is a path you decide at design time; the LLM is a step inside it. An agent is a path the LLM decides at run time, one tool call at a time, until the goal is met.

Case A's path never changes, so the loop you built adds cost, latency and failure modes for nothing. Case B's path cannot be known in advance, so it needs the loop.

The cheapest correct answer is usually the least agentic one that still solves the problem - knowing when *not* to build this is part of knowing how to build it.

## Notes for reviewers

**Validation caching.** Each `check-*.sh` caches its markers in
`/tmp/<task>.<md5-of-agent-file>`, so the several tests in one task trigger one
real run rather than one per test. Editing the agent file changes the hash and
invalidates the cache, so a re-check after a fix always re-runs. To force a
re-run by hand: `rm -f /tmp/check-*.*`.

Task 2 draws its seven checks from two scripts (`check-boundaries.sh` and
`check-resilience.sh`), each cached independently. That is why merging the old
tasks 2 and 3 needed no change to the validation scripts themselves.

**Live model calls.** `check-tool-and-loop.sh`, `check-resilience.sh` and
`check-memory-monitoring.sh` each make one cached run (roughly 2-3 API calls).
`check-boundaries.sh` makes none - a blocked prompt exits before `run_agent`,
and `filter_output` is a pure function. Grading therefore costs well under ten
calls in total, leaving ample headroom in the env's 100-request / 100k-token
quota for the learner's own iteration.

**Environment.** This env uses the legacy `kk-ai-keys-proxy`, selected by the
three `labs-manager.ai_keys_proxy_*` labels. Its model catalogue is not the
course's: the assessment runs `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, verified end to end,
while the course labs run `gpt-5.6-luna` on the post-migration gateway. Anything
outside the catalogue returns `403 ... Model '<name>' is not supported` -
`openai/gpt-4.1-mini` and the gpt-5-mini variants were all rejected here. Any
replacement must support tool calling.

Placement must stay on `scenario-type == gamma-standard` with no
`CLOUD_PROVIDER`. Two distinct failure modes, both of which leave the lab
looking healthy while every live check scores zero:

- *"Missing credentials"* - labels absent, or wrong placement.
- *"model not available"* - credentials fine, but `MODEL` names something the
  proxy does not serve.

**No `temperature` parameter.** The reference loop calls
`chat.completions.create(...)` without `temperature`, and nothing in the task
text asks for one. Some gateway models reject any value other than the default
and return a 400, which would fail every run that reaches the model - omitting
the parameter is correct whichever model the proxy pins. Worth re-checking
if that changes again.

**Task independence.** Only `check-tool-and-loop.sh` calls the model, and only
for its own `RUN_BOOKED`. Everything in Tasks 2 and 3 is a direct function call
with grader-supplied inputs, so a learner who skips Task 1 still scores those
tasks in full. Each grader caches under its own script name, so two graders can
never read each other's results.

**Measured scores.** Partial submissions graded against the shipped graders:

| Submission | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 | Automated | + quick checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nothing done | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/75 | 25/100 |
| Task 1 only | 25 | 0 | 0 | 25/75 | 50/100 |
| Task 2 only | 0 | 25 | 0 | 25/75 | 50/100 |
| Task 3 only | 0 | 0 | 25 | 25/75 | 50/100 |
| Tasks 2 + 3, no loop | 0 | 25 | 25 | 50/75 | 75/100 |
| Everything | 25 | 25 | 25 | 75/75 | 100/100 |

Each task scores exactly its own weight in isolation - no leakage between them.

Pass calibration: each task is worth 25, as is the full set of quick checks. The
three tasks alone total 75 and pass exactly; any two tasks plus all five quick
checks also lands exactly on 75. A pass therefore needs either all three build
tasks, or two of them plus every quick check correct. Reasoning alone tops out
at 25.
